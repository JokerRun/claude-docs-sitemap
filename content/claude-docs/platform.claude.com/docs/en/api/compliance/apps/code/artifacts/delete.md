# Delete Code Artifact

**DELETE** `/v1/compliance/apps/code/artifacts/{artifact_id}`

Permanently deletes a Code Artifact and all its versions. This is a
destructive operation that cannot be undone. A 200 response means the
deletion is initiated and the Artifact is claimed; content removal
completes asynchronously.

Returns 404 for Artifacts that don't exist or belong to another parent
organization. Returns 404 on a repeated delete of an already-deleted
Artifact.

## Path parameters

- `artifact_id: string`

  The Artifact ID (tagged ID, e.g., cart_abc123)

## Headers

- `"anthropic-version": string`

  The version of the Claude API to use. Send an available version on every request. A request that sends any other value, including an empty one, returns a 400 error. This endpoint treats a request that omits this header as version `2023-06-01`; some other Compliance API endpoints return a 400 error instead.

  See [API versions](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/versioning?sdk_languages=http) for the available versions.

- `"x-api-key": optional string`

## Returns

- `type: "code_artifact_deleted"`

  Constant string confirming deletion

  default: code_artifact_deleted

- `id: string`

  The ID of the Artifact that was deleted

## Example

```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/compliance/apps/code/artifacts/$ARTIFACT_ID \
    -X DELETE \
    -H 'anthropic-version: 2026-10-21' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_COMPLIANCE_API_KEY"
```

### Response (200)

```json
{
  "id": "cart_xyz789",
  "type": "code_artifact_deleted"
}
```
