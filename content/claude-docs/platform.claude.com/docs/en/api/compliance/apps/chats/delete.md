# Delete chat

**DELETE** `/v1/compliance/apps/chats/{claude_chat_id}`

Permanently deletes a chat and all associated messages and
files. This is a destructive operation that cannot be undone.

A chat's remote sessions are deleted first. If that deletion cannot be
confirmed, the request returns a 503 with error code
`chat_delete_remote_sessions_unconfirmed` and leaves the chat unchanged.
You can retry the request.
