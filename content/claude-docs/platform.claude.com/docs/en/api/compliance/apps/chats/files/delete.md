# Delete file

**DELETE** `/v1/compliance/apps/chats/files/{claude_file_id}`

Permanently deletes a specific file. This is a destructive
operation that cannot be undone.

## Path parameters

- `claude_file_id: string`

  The file ID (tagged ID, e.g., claude_file_abc123)

## Headers

- `"anthropic-version": string`

  The version of the Claude API to use. Send an available version on every request. A request that sends any other value, including an empty one, returns a 400 error. This endpoint treats a request that omits this header as version `2023-06-01`; some other Compliance API endpoints return a 400 error instead.

  See [API versions](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/api/versioning?sdk_languages=http) for the available versions.

- `"x-api-key": optional string`

## Returns

- `type: optional "claude_file_deleted"`

  Constant string confirming deletion

  default: claude_file_deleted

- `id: string`

  The ID of the file that was deleted

## Example

```bash
curl https://api.anthropic.com/v1/compliance/apps/chats/files/$CLAUDE_FILE_ID \
    -X DELETE \
    -H 'anthropic-version: 2026-10-21' \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $ANTHROPIC_COMPLIANCE_API_KEY"
```
