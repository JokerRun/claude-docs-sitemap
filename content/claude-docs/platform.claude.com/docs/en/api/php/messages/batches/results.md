## Retrieve Message Batch results

`$client->messages->batches->results(string messageBatchID): MessageBatchIndividualResponse`

**get** `/v1/messages/batches/{message_batch_id}/results`

Streams the results of a Message Batch as a `.jsonl` file.

Each line in the file is a JSON object containing the result of a single request in the Message Batch. Results are not guaranteed to be in the same order as requests. Use the `custom_id` field to match results to requests.

Learn more about the Message Batches API in our [user guide](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/batch-processing)

### Parameters

- `messageBatchID: string`

  ID of the Message Batch.

### Returns

- `MessageBatchIndividualResponse`

  - `string customID`

    Developer-provided ID created for each request in a Message Batch. Useful for matching results to requests, as results may be given out of request order.

    Must be unique for each request within the Message Batch.

  - `MessageBatchResult result`

    Processing result for this request.

    Contains a Message output if processing was successful, an error response if processing failed, or the reason why processing was not attempted, such as cancellation or expiration.

### Example

```php
<?php

require_once dirname(__DIR__) . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new Client(apiKey: 'my-anthropic-api-key');

$messageBatchIndividualResponse = $client->messages->batches->resultsStream(
  'message_batch_id'
);

var_dump($messageBatchIndividualResponse);
```
